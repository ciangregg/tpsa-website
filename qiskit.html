                <p>
                    TPSA is participating in the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025. Qiskit Fall Fest is a student-led, worldwide series of events that brings people together to explore and learn about quantum computing. As this year marks 100 years of quantum mechanics, we are hosting a number of events to celebrate this milestone.

                    Our first event of the 2025 Fall Fest was a talk by <strong>Professor John Goold</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 1st October in the Joly lecture theatre</strong>. He discussed <strong>"Dynamical simulations of many-body quantum chaos on a quantum computer"</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum circuits with local unitaries have emerged as a rich playground for the exploration of many-body quantum dynamics of discrete-time systems. While the intrinsic locality makes them particularly suited to run on current quantum processors, the task of verification at non-trivial scales is complicated for non-integrable systems. Here, we study a special class of maximally chaotic circuits known as dual unitary circuits -- exhibiting unitarity in both space and time -- that are known to have exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. With advances in noise learning and the implementation of novel error mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then probe dynamics beyond exact verification, by perturbing the circuits away from the dual unitary point, and compare our results to classical approximations with tensor networks. These results cement error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors as a trustworthy platform for the exploration and discovery of novel emergent quantum many-body phases. In addition I will discuss some work on embedding non-ergodic subspaces within dual unitary circuits.

                    As part of Qiskit Fall Fest, we're developing comprehensive learning resources to help you master Qiskit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our introduction to Qiskit features a series of <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi6_xmFFhyV7InLv7SQ3yWukIk5yYy6Ir&si=9MZ12MymBBZLq2i0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a> that guide you from fundamental concepts—including what quantum computing is and how to install Qiskit—through to advanced topics like molecular modeling. These videos offer an excellent opportunity to develop skills widely used in both quantum computing research and industry.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To apply what you've learned, work through the IBM Qiskit notebooks. These exercises cover concepts from the video series along with additional quantum computing principles.

                    Choose from two exciting challenges: Quantum Battleships or Protein Folding. In Quantum Battleships, you'll develop a quantum circuit that uses fundamental quantum concepts to locate every ship on the grid and achieve victory without firing a shot. The Protein Folding challenge invites you to create a quantum algorithm for predicting protein structures.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Both challenges are suitable for beginners getting started with Qiskit or experienced users looking to explore more advanced implementations. Find detailed information about each prompt in the sign-up form.
