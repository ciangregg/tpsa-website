                PLANCKS — the Physics League Across Numerous Countries for Kick-ass Students — is an international theoretical physics competition designed for undergraduate students. Hosted in a different country each year, it brings together some of the brightest young physicists from around the world to test their problem-solving skills in a challenging and collaborative environment. Beyond the competition itself, PLANCKS fosters international connections through lectures, lab visits, and social events, all centered around a shared passion for physics.

                Over the past few years, the TPSA has taken part in the UK and Ireland preliminary rounds, consistently fielding enthusiastic teams. In 2023, we were thrilled to qualify for the global finals — a testament to the hard work and enthusiasm of our members. Whether you're keen to compete, cheer from the sidelines, or simply meet other physics lovers, PLANCKS is an incredible opportunity to deepen your engagement with the subject and become part of a global community of aspiring scientists.
