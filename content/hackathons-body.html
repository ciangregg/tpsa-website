                    The TPSA hackathon will take place from 9thâ€“12th September, immediately following the workshops. More details about the topic and sign-ups will be announced in a later email, so keep an eye out for updates. In the meantime, the workshops are a great opportunity to brush up on your coding skills!

                <p>
                Every year we run a week of computational workshops designed to take someone from close to zero programming knowledge to having a solid base of knowledge for scientific computing. The workshops range in difficulty from introduction to Python programming to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. They also range in scope from more physics theory oriented workshops such as the theory and logic behind quantum computing to more purely computational ones such as Introduction to Machine Learning. This means anyone can find something that suits them. This year we are changing the workshop line-up to a mostly new one so make sure to follow our socials to not miss out!
                </p>
                <p>
                Building from the workshops we also run an annual week-long hackathon. Our hackathons are intended to give participants an opportunity to apply physical principles and broader scientific computing methods to problems of wider societal importance. Previously our hackathons were focused on developing an algorithm for a fair and unbiased creation of constituency boundaries to prevent gerrymandering, and on modelling the population dynamics in Ireland to eventually optimise infrastructure investment. Both produced insightful results and we are looking forward to our next hackathon coming up in September!
