                    "This year's topic is Traffic Modelling for Infrastructure Optimisation. You will be working to develop models for predicting and categorising traffic flow. Some of the topics that will be presented in the workshops, such as PDEs and complex systems, as well as basic python skills, could be used to solve this problem, so sign up for those too!

                <li>
                    The hackathon can be done in teams of up to 5 people. We will meet on the first day to give all the details of the problem. After that each team is free to work on the projects until the final presentation. Space in the SNIAM will be available for teams to work in, but you are free to work wherever and whenever you want. On Friday each group will present their progress on the questions, with awards for the winning groups. The problem will be broken down into steps that get increasingly more complex, so everyone can contribute, whether you are new to coding or have a lot of experience.
                </li>

                    This is a great opportunity to develop your coding and problem solving skills, as well as work with friends and discuss topics with other students. Furthermore, previous hackathons have led to opportunities beyond the hackathon, such as being presented at a conference and even a funded PhD, making for a great career-boosting, as well as really fun, event!"

                <p>
                Every year we run a week of computational workshops designed to take someone from close to zero programming knowledge to having a solid base of knowledge for scientific computing. The workshops range in difficulty from introduction to Python programming to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. They also range in scope from more physics theory oriented workshops such as the theory and logic behind quantum computing to more purely computational ones such as Introduction to Machine Learning. This means anyone can find something that suits them. This year we are changing the workshop line-up to a mostly new one so make sure to follow our socials to not miss out!
                </p>
                <p>
                Building from the workshops we also run an annual week-long hackathon. Our hackathons are intended to give participants an opportunity to apply physical principles and broader scientific computing methods to problems of wider societal importance. Previously our hackathons were focused on developing an algorithm for a fair and unbiased creation of constituency boundaries to prevent gerrymandering, and on modelling the population dynamics in Ireland to eventually optimise infrastructure investment. Both produced insightful results and we are looking forward to our next hackathon coming up in September!
