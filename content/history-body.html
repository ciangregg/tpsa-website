        <h1 class="blue-center tiny-bottom">A Brief History</h1>
        <h1 class="blue-center no-top">of the TPSA</h1>
        <p>The Theoretical Physics Student Association (TPSA) of Ireland was founded in 2019 by Michael Mitchell,
            alongside a group of dedicated students from Trinity College Dublin (TCD). While pursuing their studies in 
            Theoretical Physics, these forward-thinking individuals identified a significant gap in their overall development as 
            emerging professionals. They envisioned and established a space where students could collaborate and hone their social, 
            problemsolving, and explanatory skills, thus filling this gap and enhancing their professional growth.

        <p>Driven by a passion for excellence and a desire to make a substantial impact, the founders
            also aimed to elevate Ireland's standing in the global physics community. They believed that
            through their collective efforts, they could contribute to placing Ireland on the map of physics
            excellence.
        </p>
        <p> Since its inception, the TPSA has achieved notable milestones. It has played a pivotal role
            in advancing Ireland's involvement with CERN thereby integrating Ireland more deeply into the global physics research community. 
            Moreover, the TPSA has collaborated with state branches to support and uphold democratic processes, demonstrating a commitment to civic
            engagement and societal betterment as well as a keenness to work with experts outside of theoretical physics.

            <p style="width: 100%"> This particular endeavor led to the creation of a sister organization, <a href="problem-solving.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #597bb0;">The Problem Solving Association CLG</a> . This non-profit entity is dedicated to 
                providing members with opportunities to apply their unique skillsets for the benefit of society. Embracing a philosophy of 
                open-source collaboration, this organization underscores the TPSA's commitment to utilizing theoretical physics and problem-solving skills for the greater good

        <p>Through these initiatives and its ongoing dedication to fostering a collaborative, inclusive,
            and intellectually stimulating environment, the TPSA continues to contribute significantly to
            the academic and professional development of theoretical physics students across Ireland,
            while also enhancing Ireland's reputation in the global scientific community
