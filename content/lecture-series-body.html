            <p>
                We currently have three full lecture series up:
                <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAsBQk4j-Bw&list=PLi6_xmFFhyV4rd_R5LQvmBfCKUunUWgEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Analysis</a>, 
                <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGe8KxQc68&list=PLi6_xmFFhyV4Z4SKoRPB_CwGlwvPaFK-N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interesting Mechanics</a>
                and 
                <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrZWrJcV5ZM&list=PLi6_xmFFhyV7wGi54-7408-_ddlDogqXj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein Summation Convention</a>,
                all taught by fellow TP students. These lectures offer a student perspective, giving a crash course on key modules from the TP curriculum. Each series is designed specifically with the TP curriculum in mind, aiming to focus on understanding rather than overwhelming detail. We hope to cover more topics over the next few years, continuing to build a comprehensive library.

                Real Analysis tries to demystify the different aspects of this more abstract module, covering essential definitions without delving deep into formal proofs. Interesting Mechanics provides a thorough introduction to the mathematics behind mechanics, whether learning from scratch or reviewing specific topics you may be struggling with. Einstein Summation Convention attempts to break down index and tensor notation, both essential tools for any TP student.
