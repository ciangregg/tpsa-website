            <p>
                We currently have three full lecture series up:

                <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGe8KxQc68&list=PLi6_xmFFhyV4Z4SKoRPB_CwGlwvPaFK-N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interesting Mechanics</a>
                and 
                <a style="color: #597bb0;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrZWrJcV5ZM&list=PLi6_xmFFhyV7wGi54-7408-_ddlDogqXj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein Summation Convention</a>,
                all taught by fellow TP students. These lectures offer a student perspective, giving a crash course on key modules from the TP curriculum. Each series is designed specifically with the TP curriculum in mind, aiming to focus on understanding rather than overwhelming detail. We hope to cover more topics over the next few years, continuing to build a comprehensive library.

                Real Analysis tries to demystify the different aspects of this more abstract module, covering essential definitions without delving deep into formal proofs. Interesting Mechanics provides a thorough introduction to the mathematics behind mechanics, whether learning from scratch or reviewing specific topics you may be struggling with. Einstein Summation Convention attempts to break down index and tensor notation, both essential tools for any TP student.

                <h1 class="blue-center">PLANCKS</h1>
                <p>
                PLANCKS — the Physics League Across Numerous Countries for Kick-ass Students — is an international theoretical physics competition designed for undergraduate students. Hosted in a different country each year, it brings together some of the brightest young physicists from around the world to test their problem-solving skills in a challenging and collaborative environment. Beyond the competition itself, PLANCKS fosters international connections through lectures, lab visits, and social events, all centered around a shared passion for physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the past few years, the TPSA has taken part in the UK and Ireland preliminary rounds, consistently fielding enthusiastic teams. In 2023, we were thrilled to qualify for the global finals — a testament to the hard work and enthusiasm of our members. Whether you're keen to compete, cheer from the sidelines, or simply meet other physics lovers, PLANCKS is an incredible opportunity to deepen your engagement with the subject and become part of a global community of aspiring scientists.

                <h1 class="blue-center">Hackathons & Workshops</h1>
                <p>
                Every year we run a week of computational workshops designed to take someone from close to zero programming knowledge to having a solid base of knowledge for scientific computing. The workshops range in difficulty from introduction to Python programming to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. They also range in scope from more physics theory oriented workshops such as the theory and logic behind quantum computing to more purely computational ones such as Introduction to Machine Learning. This means anyone can find something that suits them. This year we are changing the workshop line-up to a mostly new one so make sure to follow our socials to not miss out!
                </p>
                <p>
                Building from the workshops we also run an annual week-long hackathon. Our hackathons are intended to give participants an opportunity to apply physical principles and broader scientific computing methods to problems of wider societal importance. Previously our hackathons were focused on developing an algorithm for a fair and unbiased creation of constituency boundaries to prevent gerrymandering, and on modelling the population dynamics in Ireland to eventually optimise infrastructure investment. Both produced insightful results and we are looking forward to our next hackathon coming up in September!
