                <p>
                    TPSA is participating in the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025. Qiskit Fall Fest is a student-led, worldwide series of events that brings people together to explore and learn about quantum computing. As this year marks 100 years of quantum mechanics, we are hosting a number of events to celebrate this milestone.

                    A panel session will bring together speakers from different areas of the quantum computing field, with participants ranging from recent graduates to professors and people working in the quantum computing industry. This presents an exciting opportunity to learn where the field of quantum technology currently stands, how it could evolve in the near future and where you can get involved, either in the quantum industry or through further academic study.
