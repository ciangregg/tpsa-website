                <p>
                    TPSA is participating in the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025. Qiskit Fall Fest is a student-led, worldwide series of events that brings people together to explore and learn about quantum computing. As this year marks 100 years of quantum mechanics, we are hosting a number of events to celebrate this milestone.

                    Our first event of the 2025 Fall Fest will be a talk by <strong>Professor John Goold</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 1st October in the Joly lecture theatre</strong>. He will discuss <strong>"Dynamical simulations of many-body quantum chaos on a quantum computer"</strong>. Whether you know a lot about quantum computing, or are completely new to the subject, this will definitely be a fascinating talk.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum circuits with local unitaries have emerged as a rich playground for the exploration of many-body quantum dynamics of discrete-time systems. While the intrinsic locality makes them particularly suited to run on current quantum processors, the task of verification at non-trivial scales is complicated for non-integrable systems. Here, we study a special class of maximally chaotic circuits known as dual unitary circuits -- exhibiting unitarity in both space and time -- that are known to have exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. With advances in noise learning and the implementation of novel error mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then probe dynamics beyond exact verification, by perturbing the circuits away from the dual unitary point, and compare our results to classical approximations with tensor networks. These results cement error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors as a trustworthy platform for the exploration and discovery of novel emergent quantum many-body phases. In addition I will discuss some work on embedding non-ergodic subspaces within dual unitary circuits.

                    A panel session will bring together speakers from different areas of the quantum computing field, with participants ranging from recent graduates to professors and people working in the quantum computing industry. This presents an exciting opportunity to learn where the field of quantum technology currently stands, how it could evolve in the near future and where you can get involved, either in the quantum industry or through further academic study.
