                <p>
                    TPSA are participlating in the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025. Qiskit Fall Fest is a student-led, worldwide series of events that brings people together to explore and learn about quantum computing. As this year is the International Year of Quantum, we will be holding a number of events to celebrate this. 
                </p>

                 We will open with a talk by Professor John Goold of Trinity College Dublin and Director of the Trinity Quantum Alliance. This will be on the 3rd of October.

                <p>
                 We will also be holding a panel session with speakers with different places in the quantum computing field. We will have speakers ranging from recent gradates to professors and people working in the quantum computing industry. This will be an exciting opportunity to learn where the field of quantum technology as a whole is currently at, how it could evolve in the near future and where you can get involved, either in the quantum industry or through further academic study.

                    Through the TPSA YouTube channel we will release introductory content to educate participants on the basics of quantum computing and Qiskit. Along with these, there will be in-person sessions to answer any questions, in both trinity and ucd. You will be able to put your new skills into practise in the hackathon, where you can use qiskit to answer some questions at the forefront of morern research.

                <p>
                Every year we run a week of computational workshops designed to take someone from close to zero programming knowledge to having a solid base of knowledge for scientific computing. The workshops range in difficulty from introduction to Python programming to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. They also range in scope from more physics theory oriented workshops such as the theory and logic behind quantum computing to more purely computational ones such as Introduction to Machine Learning. This means anyone can find something that suits them. This year we are changing the workshop line-up to a mostly new one so make sure to follow our socials to not miss out!
                </p>
                <p>
                Building from the workshops we also run an annual week-long hackathon. Our hackathons are intended to give participants an opportunity to apply physical principles and broader scientific computing methods to problems of wider societal importance. Previously our hackathons were focused on developing an algorithm for a fair and unbiased creation of constituency boundaries to prevent gerrymandering, and on modelling the population dynamics in Ireland to eventually optimise infrastructure investment. Both produced insightful results and we are looking forward to our next hackathon coming up in September!
